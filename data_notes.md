## About this simulator

The Public School Forum of North Carolinaâ€™s School Funding Formula Simulator is an interactive modeling tool to help state policymakers, education leaders, and advocates visualize and explore the impacts of proposed changes to North Carolina's school funding formula. By adjusting formula inputs, such as base funding and weights for student needs, users can immediately see how various scenarios affect district-level funding. 

The data used in this simulator are from the 2023-24 school year. The current funding numbers include only state per-pupil expenditures. Charter schools are not currently accounted for in this simulator.
