## About this simulator

Bellwetherâ€™s School Funding Formula Simulator is an illustrative example of the interactive modeling tools we build to help state policymakers, education leaders, and advocates visualize and explore the impacts of proposed changes to state school funding formulas. By adjusting formula inputs, such as base funding and weights for student needs, users can immediately see how various scenarios affect resource distribution district-level funding. Users can also quickly select scenarios with pre-determined input settings.

This hands-on approach fosters informed decision-making, ensures transparency, and equips stakeholders with actionable insights to design funding formulas that better meet the diverse needs of students and communities across the state.

The data in this simulator are a synthetic example of a state. The district names are randomly generated, as are the student counts and current funding levels. Simulators also typically include a map view, but that option is not shown given the constraints of the synthetic data used in this simulator.
